In this project is going to make an example with pandas' library in Python.

Will see the differences between Series and DataFrame:

  - **Series**: Is a unidimensional array with indexation. Similar to dictionary.
  - **DataFrame**: Data structure similar to excel or SQL table.
  

For this example i used the "MovieLens" data set that contains information of users, films and ratings. 

## Prerequisites
Is necessary to install next libraries (with pip):
```bash
$ pip install pandas
$ pip install numpy
```
